        <h1>Hotspot Popups</h1>
        <p class="note"><span class="Emphasis">Note: </span>Hotspot topic popups are not supported in some online outputs or in print-based outputs. In HTML5, they do not work if you are using a main skin (e.g., Side Navigation, Top Navigation, Tripane), so the HTML5 output in this project is set up to be skinless (in that it doesn't use a main skin). We also created snippets from the content used for those popups and added them here as regular text to include that content in the PDF&#160;output. Then we applied conditions to the different areas, and to the three topic files that are used for the popups.</p>
        <p>There are many places to visit in Austin. Three of these are the State Capitol, Zilker Park, and Lady Bird Lake. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlineOnly">Click on the numbered circles on the map to learn about each.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
